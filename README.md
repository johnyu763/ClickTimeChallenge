# ClickTimeChallenge
This is my implementation of The Race Around the World, which is question 1 of the ClickTime Intern Challenge.

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

In the process of making this web app, I had some minor issues. The most notable was with using local storage. In order to allow for the app to remember the history, I had to store the table into a String. My solution was to store the inner HTML of the table. Overall, this project was not too difficult to implement, I simply needed to get back into practice.
